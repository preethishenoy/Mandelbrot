This is an app which implements mandelbrot for iOS with gesture controls.
The implementation has two approaches,
1. Mandelbrot using UIKit gestures which renders image with smooth gesture handling.
2. Mandelbrot using SwiftUI gestures which renders high definition image but relatively slow gesture handling.
